// Approach:
// Since the array contains distinct numbers in the range [0, n] hence if we calculate xor of all the numbers in this
// range and then xor it with the actual elements present in the array it will give us the element which is missing.
// This is because x ^ x = 0, so all the numbers will result in 0 except the one which is missing.

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int ans = n;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans ^= nums[i] ^ i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
